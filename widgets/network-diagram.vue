<!-- The template is really trivial: all we need is a div into which vis-network can put its canvas.
     There is some magic necessary so the div fills the whole widget. It's in a flex-column
     container so we want it to grow/shrink to match the container height. We also want it to be
     100% width and we add a couple of pixels of padding left and right. Finally,
     overflow-hidden is important so the element size calculation is correct in onResize.
     All this is accomplished by the classes, which are from Vuetify.
     The same could be achieved by using straight CSS.
     We give the div a "ref", which is a unique ID, so we can get a handle to the DOM element
     in the code, basically like an "id=<something>" attribute.
